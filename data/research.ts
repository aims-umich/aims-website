    title: "Multi-objective combinatorial methodology for nuclear reactor site assessment: A case study for the United States",
    authors: ["Omer Erdem", "Kevin Daley", "Gabrielle Hoelzle", "Majdi I. Radaideh"],
    journal: "Energy Conversion and Management: X",
    year: 2025,
    abstract: "As clean energy demand grows to meet sustainability and net-zero goals, nuclear energy emerges as a reliable option. However, high capital costs remain a challenge for nuclear power plants (NPP), where repurposing coal power plant sites (CPP) with existing infrastructure is one way to reduce these costs. Additionally, Brownfield sites — previously developed or underutilized lands often impacted by industrial activity — present another compelling alternative. This study introduces a novel multi-objective optimization methodology, leveraging combinatorial search to evaluate over 30,000 potential NPP sites in the United States. Our approach addresses gaps in the current practice of assigning pre-determined weights to each site attribute that could lead to bias in the ranking. Each site is assigned a performance-based score, derived from a detailed combinatorial analysis of its site attributes. The methodology generates a comprehensive database comprising site locations (inputs), attributes (outputs), site score (outputs), and the contribution of each attribute to the site score. We then use this database to train a neural network model, enabling rapid predictions of nuclear siting suitability across any location in the United States. Our findings highlight that CPP sites are highly competitive for nuclear development, but some Brownfield sites are able to compete with them. Notably, four CPP sites in Ohio, North Carolina, and New Hampshire, and two Brownfield sites in Florida and California rank among the most promising locations. These results underscore the potential of integrating machine learning and optimization techniques to transform nuclear siting, paving the way for a cost-effective and sustainable energy future.",

    title: "Multiphysics Modeling of Heat Pipe Microreactor with Critical Control Drum Position Search",
    authors: ["Dean Price", "Nathan Roskoff", "Majdi I. Radaideh", "Brendan Kochunas"],
    journal: "Nuclear Science and Engineering",
    year: 2024,
    abstract: "A multiphysics coupling methodology for heat pipe microreactors is presented in this work that includes a focus on a critical control drum position search routine and burnup capabilities. As the Serpent code is used for neutronics calculations, the recently developed GRsecant method for finding critical control drum positions is employed, which has explicit measures to manage the uncertainty introduced from the Monte Carlo calculation method. This work complements existing multiphysics modeling tools for heat pipe microreactors because it can be used to generate cross sections with fuel compositions determined by depletion with critical control drum positions. These methods are applied to a microreactor design motivated by the eVinciTM heat pipe microreactor. The convergence of the multiphysics coupling routine is analyzed at multiple burnup points. The multiphysics iterations with critical control drum search were observed to converge for all calculations performed in this work. Overall, the multiphysics coupling procedure enables the calculation of both thermal and neutronics characteristics with control drums in their critical positions for the core lifetime.",

    authors: ["Dean Price", "Nathan Roskoff", "Majdi I. Radaideh", "Brendan Kochunas"],
    journal: "Nuclear Engineering and Design",
    year: 2023,
    abstract: "The simulation of heat pipe microreactors is an active area of research. In this paper, a thermal analysis of a heat pipe microreactor motivated by the eVinci™ design is performed. Thorough discussion on the modeling of heat pipes without a dedicated heat pipe modeling code, such as Sockeye, is also provided. The performance of two heat pipe modeling techniques is compared, one a more accurate approach which explicitly tracks heat pipe temperatures, and the other an approximation which simplifies the thermal hydraulic model development. One-way coupling is used where the Serpent neutronics code is used to generate a power distribution which is applied in an OpenFOAM model to calculate a temperature distribution. After a detailed convergence analysis, the core temperature distribution resulting from a core with control drums facing outward, or fully withdrawn, is compared with one having the control drums facing inward, or fully inserted. Finally, a parametric analysis was performed where the thermal resistances associated with the heat pipe model were varied and core temperatures were tracked. It was observed that the relationship between average and maximum core temperatures had a highly linear relationship to the thermal resistances used in the heat pipe model.",

    abstract: "We present an open-source Python framework for NeuroEvolution Optimization with Reinforcement Learning (NEORL) developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. NEORL offers a global optimization interface of state-of-the-art algorithms in the field of evolutionary computation, neural networks through reinforcement learning, and hybrid neuroevolution algorithms. NEORL features diverse set of algorithms, user-friendly interface, parallel computing support, automatic hyperparameter tuning, detailed documentation, and demonstration of applications in mathematical and real-world engineering optimization. NEORL encompasses various optimization problems from combinatorial, continuous, mixed discrete/continuous, to high-dimensional, expensive, and constrained engineering optimization. In this paper, NEORL is tested in a variety of engineering applications relevant to low carbon energy research in addressing solutions to climate change. The examples include nuclear reactor control, nuclear fuel optimization, mechanical and structural design optimization, and fuel cell power production. The results demonstrate NEORL competitiveness against other algorithms and optimization frameworks in the literature, and a potential tool to solve large-scale optimization problems.

    title: "Multiobjective optimization of nuclear microreactor reactivity control system operation with swarm and evolutionary algorithms",
    authors: ["Dean Price", "Majdi I. Radaideh", "Brendan Kochunas"],
    journal: "Nuclear Engineering and Design",
    year: 2022,
    abstract: "To improve the marketability of novel microreactor designs, there is a need for automated and optimal control of these reactors. This paper presents a methodology for performing multiobjective optimization of control drum operation for a microreactor under normal and off-nominal conditions. Two different case studies are used where the control drum configuration is optimized for the reactor to be critical with some desired power distribution that would satisfy peaking limits. A surrogate model for power distribution is developed based on a feedforward neural network. The process for determining weights for scalarization of the multiobjective optimization problem is also detailed. Six optimization algorithms: evolutionary strategies, differential evolution, grey wolf optimization, Harris hawks optimization, moth flame optimization and particle swarm optimization, are all applied to these cases and the results analyzed. Although all these algorithms will demonstrate optima-seeking behavior, for real-time control it is necessary to identify the best algorithm to efficiently provide reasonable optima without operator interference. The moth flame optimization algorithm was found to perform particularly well on both cases. Overall, it was found that the algorithms capable of supplying the best optima were also the most consistent. Finally, the found optima were verified with the original model used to train surrogates.",
