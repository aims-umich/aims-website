      'The AIMS Lab at the University of Michigan has been awarded a $2.5 million grant from the Department of Energy\'s Nuclear Energy University Program (NEUP) to develop advanced simulation tools for next-generation nuclear reactors. The project, titled "Multi-Physics Simulation Framework for Molten Salt Reactors," will focus on creating high-fidelity computational models that couple neutronics, thermal-hydraulics, and structural mechanics.\n\nLed by Principal Investigator Dr. Majdi Radaideh, the research team will collaborate with scientists from Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Idaho National Laboratory to develop and validate the simulation framework. The tools developed through this project will help accelerate the design and licensing of molten salt reactors, which offer potential advantages in safety, efficiency, and waste reduction compared to conventional nuclear reactors.\n\n"This grant will enable us to push the boundaries of nuclear simulation technology," said Dr. Radaideh. "By developing more accurate and computationally efficient tools, we can help bring advanced reactor designs from concept to reality more quickly and with greater confidence in their performance and safety."\n\nThe project is expected to run for three years and will involve several graduate students and postdoctoral researchers from the AIMS Lab.',
